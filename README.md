<h1>VOICE CONTROLLED CLASSROOMS</h1>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>Voice controlled room is a lifestyle changing project in the field of IoT- Internet of things.
We all are tired of the situations when we are sitting in one end of the room and we have to walk 
the whole room just to turn on the fan or sitting in sofa after a long tiring day and then you have 
to again stand up just to look for the remote of AC and other appliances. But now these things can 
come very handy as we can solve the problems by the device we always useto carry with us. Yes,obviously, 
The Smartphones. How about a voice command to turn on or off any appliance in room.You can give a 
simple voice command on a app on your phone and there we go commanding the appliances of the room.
We can the room on auto mode to take your care according to the weather and lights of the room.</pre>

<br/>
<h2>Smart campus extension</h2>
<pre>This project can be used for the smart campus in the classrooms, offices, lobbies or anywhere. 
This project is very secure as we use the bluetooth for communication medium instead of internet. 
So less chances of unauthorized control. Lighting, fans, ACs in the room,you just need a voice command. 
We can control the lifts, electronic gates of the campus and many more. This module can be very useful 
for the smart campus project.</pre>

<h2>Functionality and usefulness of the project</h2>
<pre>This project allows you to control all the appliances in a room with the voice command. 
It becomes useful in saving electricity in auto mode as it optimise the system according to 
the temperature and the light intensity in the room.This module of voice command comes very 
handy in use as it has a very easy functionality. We do not need a different device or 
something in this project for voice command, we can simply have voice command from a mobile 
App(application) available on the stores of smartphones such as Google Play Store for Android, 
IOS App store or windows store for windows phones.In this project I am using the android for 
demonstrating, here the app that I am using is AMR_Voice. This application in the phone is 
connected to the bluetooth module of the circuit which receives the text conversion of voice 
command done by the smartphone application.The microcontroller board in the circuit interprets 
the text from the bluetooth module and control the appliances using an electronic switch called relay.</pre>
